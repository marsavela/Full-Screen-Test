Full Screen Test
==============

A very simple application to provide Fullscreen screen test.

Mainly for Android 4.4 Kitkat with onscreen navigation buttons.

Also can be used as a ViewPager looping and Fragment management example.

==============

Test your display after dead or stuck pixels. A lot of new devices came with this kind of failing and you don't even notice. The application fills the screen, even the on screen navigation bar, with a single color at maximum brightness, allowing the user to easily find pixels that fail to show the certain color.

9 Available Colors:
Red, Green, Blue, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black (Key), Grey (50% of Red, 50% of Green, 50% of Blue), White (100% of All colors)

Almost all type of screens work with those sub-pixel colors.

No ADS nor weird permissions.
